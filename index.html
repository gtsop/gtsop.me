  As a developer I make a ton of decisions without knowing the actuall impact
  of those decisions on the browser or on the user's experience. That will not
  be the case here. Everything written in this project must be justified. The
  idea of this concept is not to create a better user experience by making the
  best choises, but learning how everything works at a deeper level.

  So, let's begin. The first line in this file contains the document type
  declaration which is used by the web browser to associate the served document
  with a specific document type definition (DTD), enabling the appropriate
  parsing mode of the browser. In this project I don't want to be compatible
  with older browser versions, so I'll just use the "standard" mode.Here is
  more info on this subject:

  The reason this comment is written after the DTD is because all versions of
  IE will use the "quirks" mode if the first line of the document does not 
  contain the DTD.
