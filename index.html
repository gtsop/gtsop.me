  As a developer I make a ton of decisions without knowing the actuall impact
  of those decisions on the browser or on the user's experience. That will not
  be the case here. Everything written in this project must be justified. The
  idea of this concept is not to create a better user experience by making the
  best choises, but learning how everything works at a deeper level.

  So, let's begin. The first line in this file contains the document type
  declaration which is used by the web browser to associate the served document
  with a specific document type definition (DTD), enabling the appropriate
  parsing mode of the browser. In this project I don't want to be compatible
  with older browser versions, so I'll just use the "standard" mode.Here is
  more info on this subject:

  The reason this comment is written after the DTD is because all versions of
  IE will use the "quirks" mode if the first line of the document does not
  contain the DTD.

  The specification tells us that HTML, HEAD and BODY tags make up the main
  frame of an HTML document... but it also tells us we can ommit them.

  (https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#optional-start-and-end-tags)

  QUESTION 1: Why can we omit these tags?

  Online resources suggest that the reason the specs allows omiting the tags in
  question is to be backwards compatible with older standards that didn't define
  these tags.

  QUESTION 2: Why should we omit these tags?

  The benefits of omiting the tags, as argued by other developers, boil down to:
  - Less code
  - Less file size (at scale)
  - Less network bandwidth (at scale)
  - If there is no need, why bother?

  There are all nice to have. On the other hand, omiting them can also:
  - Lead to developer errors
  - Be prone to implementation errors

  These are bad, but not TOO worrying. The first deal breaker for me though is
  the following:

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <title>test page</title>
  <script></script>

  Can you answer, just by looking at the code, where will the browser render the
  script tag? Will it be the HEAD or will it be the BODY? The answer is it
  doesn't matter. We stumbled uppon unspecified behaviour which is the worst
  thing to rely on. However, this problem doesn't justify including all three
  of the tags in question (html, head, body). This problem can be resolved by
  using only one of the head or body tags. For instance:

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <title>test page</title>
  </head>
  <script></script>

  Right? No. Run this code to see for yourself that firefox still renders the
  script on the header tag also marks it as an error. The html validator throws
  "Error: script element between head and body". What about the opposite then?

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <title>test page</title>
  <body>
    <script></script>
  </body>

  It works! We can declare with confidence: One should NOT omit the body tag.
